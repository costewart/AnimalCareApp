<h1>Animal Care App</h1>
<p> With the goal of enhancing communication between animal care providers (veterinarians, groomers and boarders) and clients, this desktop application allows clients to create an account to schedule appointments, receive pet status updates and view past report cards (a few notes on how the pet behaved during the appointment). Animal care providers are able to create an admin account to view the same features as the client, and additional notes such as client alerts.</p>
